# This doc file will have practice of intro python and variables
# Practice will inlcude random runs and tests to understand functions
# Notes of syntax and concepts included

# START

#Concept 1 "PRINT" -------------------------------

print("Hello World") 
    # Use "" (double quotation) to define text string
    # Can also use '' (single quotation) to define as a text string

#End -------------------------------------------

#Concept 2 "VARIABLES" 

int = 1
    # Space before and after the = sign
    # Defines the variable a select value

print(int)
   
    # Basic functions with integers
n1 = 1
n2 = 2

print(n1 + n2)
print(n1 - n2)
print(n1 * n2)
print(n1 / n2)

# Space before and after the operation symbol

# Floats = Decimal numbers
# Can be defined with the same syntax

float1 = 2.5
float2 = 1.5

print(float1 + float2)
print(float1 - float2)
print(float1 * float2)
print(float1 / float2)

# Multiple Operations
    #1 Numbers

num1 = 3
num2 = 4
sum = num1 + num2

print(sum)

# Text 
# Add "" in between + signs to identify text string or add space

string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "world"
string3 = string1 + " " +  string2

print(string3)

# Simultanoues actions

a, b = 4, 5

print(a, b)



#End ----------------------------------------------
