# Rakin_Capstone

The project is to create a Calculator with a GUI using Python and Tkinter 

# Advanced Calculator
This text based calculator is a simple, interactive Python-based calculator that offers basic arithmetic, mathematical functions, and angle conversions. The calculator supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, factorial, and more. This calculator was made to get experience with the coding aspect behind making this sort of program as this was the first time I did a big python project. 

# Tkinter Simple Calculator
This calculator is a simple GUI-based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly interface with basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the use of parentheses for grouping operations. This calculator was created to get experience with using tkinter to create GUI for code. 

# Advanced GUI Calculator (Final Product)
This calculator is a Python-based GUI calculator built with customtkinter. It supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical functions (square root, factorial, absolute value), trigonometric functions, and angle conversions between radians and degrees. The purpose for this calculator was to combine the previous 2 versions of calculators and combine them together to make a GUI based calculator that can handle complex calculations

# Features of Advanced GUI Calculator 
1) Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2) Advanced Operations: Square root, factorial, absolute value, exponentiation
3) Trigonometric Functions: Sin, Cos, Tan (radians)
4) Angle Conversions: Degrees â†” Radians
5) Input Validation: Handles invalid inputs and math errors (e.g., division by zero)
6) Result Rounding: Round results to 4 decimal places

Thank you for using my calculators!
