The project is to create a Calculator with a GUI using Python and Tkinter 

# Simple Calculator

# Tkinter Simple Calculator

# Advanced GUI Calculator
This calculator is a Python-based GUI calculator built with customtkinter. It supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical functions (square root, factorial, absolute value), trigonometric functions, and angle conversions between radians and degrees.
# Features
1) Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2) Advanced Operations: Square root, factorial, absolute value, exponentiation
3) Trigonometric Functions: Sin, Cos, Tan (radians)
4) Angle Conversions: Degrees â†” Radians
5) Input Validation: Handles invalid inputs and math errors (e.g., division by zero)
6) Result Rounding: Round results to 4 decimal places
